Questions to Poureya:

Focusing on the steel Frame steel Deck design: When it comes to analysis and design there are some questions and dwefinitions that may or may not need the input from user. Below are few that needs help.

1- Frame Section Property candidates:
During the design optimization, the agent needs to define the candidates for sections to be picked.
One way is to let Compass to pick the best by considering all available options. But what if User has their own input criteria. The user input could be: re

a- Section types:
W (Wide Flange)
C (Channel)
L (Angle)
HSS (Hollow Structural Sections)
WT (Tee)
2L (Double Angle)

b- Section Propery Range:
Each section types has fairly wide range of geometries. For isntance for W type:

W24 series (e.g., W24x55, W24x62, W24x68, etc.)
W21 series (e.g., W21x44, W21x50, W21x57, etc.)
W18 series (e.g., W18x35, W18x40, W18x46, etc.)
W16 series (e.g., W16x26, W16x31, W16x36, etc.)
W14 series (e.g., W14x22, W14x26, W14x30, etc.)
W12 series (e.g., W12x19, W12x22, W12x26, etc.)
W10 series (e.g., W10x15, W10x19, W10x22, etc.)
W8 series (e.g., W8x10, W8x13, W8x15, etc.)
W6 series (e.g., W6x9, W6x12, W6x15, etc.)
W5 series (e.g., W5x16, W5x19, etc.)
W4 series (e.g., W4x13, etc.)

Do we expect user to define specific sections? FOr instance just consider W21 Series. Or more details?

2- Grouping Requirements:
